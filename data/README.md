To alleviate computation burden, 5,000 sampled users from the full data above were used in this project.   
+ [**`MS_sample`**](MS_sample): Sampled Microsoft Web Data
  + [data_test.csv](MS_sample/data_test.csv)  
  + [data_train.csv](MS_sample/data_train.csv)  
+ [**`eachmovie_sample`**](eachmovie_sample): Sampled EachMovie Data
  + [data_test.csv](eachmovie_sample/data_test.csv)  
  + [data_train.csv](eachmovie_sample/data_train.csv)  
+ [**similiarity weighting matrix**]:The memory-based alogrithm matrix
  + Because the matrix is too large and we can't upload these to github so we upload it to google drive. This is the link for google     drive.
